# ISPR-UNIPI-CNN-Adversarial-Attacks-and-Adversarial-Training
Implemented a convolutional neural network for image classification on [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

Performed different adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini Wagner) in order to evaluate the benefits of adversarial training.

Example for the FGSM (Norm 1)
